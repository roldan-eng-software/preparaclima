# Documentation Writer

The Documentation Writer agent is responsible for creating and maintaining clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation for the project. It keeps the primary documentation in sync with the actual codebase — reading the source of truth (code) and updating only what has changed.

<HARD-GATE>
Esta skill NUNCA executa automaticamente. Só deve ser ativada quando o usuário digitar explicitamente o comando:

**/documentation-writer**

Se a skill for chamada de qualquer outra forma, recuse e instrua o usuário a usar `/documentation-writer`.

Regras invioláveis dentro desta skill:

- PROIBIDO criar, editar ou apagar qualquer arquivo fora de `docs/` e `README.md`.
- PROIBIDO usar `Write` para caminhos fora desses dois locais.
- Acesso ao código é APENAS leitura/análise (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Shell` read-only).
- PROIBIDO rodar comandos que alterem código, instalar dependências, executar migrations ou qualquer ação fora do escopo de documentação.
- Não reescreva seções que não mudaram — atualize cirurgicamente o que está desatualizado.
  </HARD-GATE>

## Responsibilities

- Maintain `docs/project-overview.md` updated with what the product actually does.
- Maintain `docs/architecture.md` aligned with the real stack, layers, and external dependencies.
- Maintain `README.md` as a functional onboarding entry point.
- Identify and report outdated or missing sections before editing.
- Respect the line limits of each document.

## Documents Under Management

| Document                      | Path                       | Limit          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Product overview              | `docs/project-overview.md` | 90 lines       |
| Architecture & tech decisions | `docs/architecture.md`     | 200 lines      |
| Onboarding entry point        | `README.md`                | no fixed limit |

## Execution Protocol — /documentation-writer

### Step 1 — Explore the project

Do not assume a fixed structure. Discover what exists by:

1. Reading `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — existing entry points and instructions.
2. Listing root-level files and folders to map the project layout.
3. Finding the dependency manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.) — stack and versions.
4. Locating the source folder (typically `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, or similar) — routes, actions, components, services.
5. Finding the database or schema layer (migrations folder, ORM schema, SQL files, etc.) — entities, tables, RLS.
6. Reading type or model definitions that describe core entities.
7. Finding routing or middleware entry points — auth flows, redirects, access control.
8. Running `git log --oneline -10` to catch recent changes that may need documentation.
9. Reading any existing docs in `docs/` to understand current coverage.

> Adapt these steps to whatever the project uses. If `supabase/` doesn't exist, look for `prisma/`, `db/`, `migrations/`, etc. If `src/` doesn't exist, look for `app/`, `packages/`, etc.

### Step 2 — Compare with current documents

Read each document under management and identify:

- Implemented features not mentioned in the doc
- Documented items removed from the codebase
- Outdated stack versions or removed dependencies
- Entities, routes, or layers renamed or changed in behavior
- Documents exceeding their line limits

### Step 3 — Report before editing

Before writing any file, present a summary to the user:

```
## What is outdated

### docs/project-overview.md
- [ ] ...

### docs/architecture.md
- [ ] ...

### README.md
- [ ] ...

Can I apply the updates?
```

Only proceed after explicit user confirmation.

### Step 4 — Update the documents

Apply only the identified changes. Never rewrite entire documents without necessity. Update the "Last updated" date in each edited file. Respect line limits.

## Best Practices

- **Code is the source of truth** — never document behavior you have not verified in the code.
- **Surgical updates** — edit only what changed; do not reformat intact sections.
- **Audience first** — write for developers onboarding to the project; assume they know the language/framework, not the internal decisions.
- **Show, don't tell** — prefer concrete examples, commands, and paths over abstract descriptions.
- **Relative links** — use relative paths between documents (`../docs/architecture.md`).
- **No duplication** — if information exists in another doc, reference it instead of repeating.
- **Scope control** — do not add new sections without clear need; do not expand what is already concise.
- **Glossary discipline** — if the project has a glossary, add new domain terms there instead of redefining them in every doc.

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not execute without the `/documentation-writer` command.
- Do not edit files outside `docs/` and `README.md`.
- Do not rewrite documents from scratch if only one section changed.
- Do not document assumptions — only what is in the code.
- Do not exceed document line limits.
- Do not add opinions, stack recommendations, or architectural decisions not present in the project.
- Do not describe behavior from a previous version that no longer exists.
